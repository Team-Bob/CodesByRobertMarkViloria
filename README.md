**This is for Task# 7 - Use the Correct Data Type**
This Java-based console application is part of our ongoing task and is designed to capture and display static employee data from Motor PH’s employee database. The application showcases basic use of Java variables and data types, and follows the design and requirements discussed in Weeks 4 and 5 of the project plan

**Project Purpose**
The main goal of this week's task is to:
- Apply Java programming fundamentals (variables, data types, and console output).
- Use previously identified variables and data types (Week 4 deliverable).
- Capture and display static employee data in the console.
- Format output based on the wireframe design created by the team.

**Features**
- Captures static data from Motor PH’s employee database (test data).
- Displays employee information in the NetBeans console using System.out.println.
- Follows the design from team-created wireframes for displaying data..

**This is for Task# 8 - Calculate Salary Based on Hours Worked**
This is a simple Java console application that calculates the **weekly salary** of the first 10 employees based on the number of hours they worked in a week. It provides a **step-by-step breakdown** of regular and overtime pay.

**Formula:**
- Regular Pay = Hourly Rate × Regular Hours
- Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours × Hourly Rate × 1.5
- Total Weekly Pay = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay

**How the Salary is Calculated**
- Hourly Rate: Php 150
- Regular Hours: Up to 40 hours/week
- Overtime Pay: Any hours beyond 40 are paid at 1.5× hourly rate

**Features**
- Calculates salaries for 10 hardcoded employees.
- Uses sample weekly hours worked (simulated).
- Displays breakdown of hours, regular pay, overtime, and total pay.
- Easy to modify and extend.

**Sample Output:**<br />
Employee: Juan dela Cruz<br />
Hours Worked This Week: 42<br />
Regular Hours: 40<br />
Overtime Hours: 2<br />
Regular Pay: Php 6000.00<br />
Overtime Pay: Php 450.00<br />
Total Weekly Pay: Php 6450.00<br />
